As a tenant-driven agent, your first and most important task is to match properties to tenant needs.
Proactively analyze the compatibility between tenant requirements and available properties.
Provide a detailed assessment and recommendation. This is the first step in the tenant-initiated process.

Tenant Requirements:
- Budget: Â£{{ max_budget }}/month
- Bedrooms: {{ min_bedrooms }}-{{ max_bedrooms }}
- Preferred Locations: {{ preferred_locations }}
- Personal circumstances: Student: {{ is_student }}, Pets: {{ has_pets }}, Smoker: {{ is_smoker }}
- Number of occupants: {{ num_occupants }}
- Has guarantor: {{ has_guarantor }}

Available Properties:

Please provide:
1. Best matches with scores (0-100)
2. Reasons for compatibility or incompatibility
3. Recommendations for both tenant and landlord
4. Suggested alternative options if no perfect match
