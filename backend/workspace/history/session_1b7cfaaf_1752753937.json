I'm particularly interested in knowing if pets are allowed, as I have one. \n\nLooking forward to your response!",

Perhaps we can find a middle ground.\n\nRegarding amenities, the apartment offers a modern living space, fitted kitchen, and access to the vibrant Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park area. Unfortunately, I must inform you that the property is not pet-friendly.\n\nAs for lease terms, I typically require a security deposit of five weeks' rent. If you'd like to proceed with the discussion, let me know your thoughts!",

This might influence my decision.\n\nCould you please clarify the lease terms regarding the duration and any additional fees? I look forward to your response!",
