Unfortunately, this is significantly above your budget of £938. \n\nRegarding amenities, the apartment features modern fittings and is part of a contemporary development in a vibrant area. However, I must mention that my properties do not allow pets.\n\nWhile I appreciate your budget, I can't reduce the rent to fit it. If you’re open to adjusting your budget, I can discuss potential flexibility. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!",
