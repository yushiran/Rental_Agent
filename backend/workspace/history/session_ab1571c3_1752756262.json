Given your budget of £1,076, I might be able to negotiate slightly, but it would need to be within a reasonable range.\n  \n2. The apartment is part of a contemporary development with modern amenities, including a fitness center, communal garden, and secure entry. It’s located near Hackney Wick station, providing easy access to public transport.\n\n3. Unfortunately, there is no dedicated parking available for this property.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like to discuss the rent further!",
