The property is available for immediate move-in, which could be perfect for you.\n\nSince your budget is slightly above the asking rent, I'm open to negotiating. If you can assure me of your stable income and responsibility as a tenant, I think we can find a suitable arrangement. Would you like to discuss a specific offer?",
