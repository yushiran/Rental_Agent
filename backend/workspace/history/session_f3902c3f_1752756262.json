The property is a 2-bedroom apartment at Makers House, Stratford, with a monthly rent of £2,800. \n\nRegarding additional fees, there's a security deposit of 6 weeks' rent. Unfortunately, your budget of £1,965 is below the asking price, but considering your stable income and reliability, I can offer to negotiate the rent. \n\nHow about we discuss a potential adjustment? I could consider a reduced rent closer to your budget. Let me know your thoughts!",
