The apartment offers modern amenities and is situated in the vibrant Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park area.\n\nRegarding your budget, I appreciate your interest and your responsible tenant profile. However, the asking rent is significantly above your budget. While I'm open to negotiations, I typically consider adjustments within 10-15% of the asking price. \n\nSince my property is pet-friendly, that's a plus! If you're willing to discuss a higher budget, we can explore options. Let me know!",
