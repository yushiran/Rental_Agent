It features a modern design, located in the heart of Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, and is pet-friendly.\n\nRegarding flexibility, your budget of £1,737 is below my asking price, but I can consider negotiating. I might be able to offer a discount if you seem like a reliable tenant. \n\nAs for amenities, the apartment includes modern fixtures, spacious living areas, and access to local parks and transport links. If you're keen, we can discuss what works for both of us!",
