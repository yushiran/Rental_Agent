Also, could you provide details about the amenities and the neighborhood? \n\nGiven my budget of £926/month, I hope we can discuss the rent if it's above that amount. I'm a responsible tenant with a stable income and looking for a comfortable space for myself and another occupant. \n\nThank you, and I look forward to your response!",

Unfortunately, your budget of £926 is significantly below the asking price.\n\nThe apartment features modern amenities and is located in the vibrant Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park area, which offers great local parks, shops, and transport links. \n\nWhile I'm open to discussing rental terms, the price difference is quite substantial. If you have any flexibility in your budget or if we could discuss potential options, I'd be happy to consider them. Let me know what you think!",
