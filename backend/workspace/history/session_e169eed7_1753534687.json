I have a stable income and a guarantor, so I'm confident I'll be a good tenant. Looking forward to your response!",

It’s part of a contemporary development in the vibrant Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park area.\n\nRegarding amenities, the apartment offers a modern design and is pet-friendly, which is great if you have pets. However, please note that I cannot lower the rent to £1,472, as it's outside a reasonable range. \n\nGiven your stable income and guarantor, I can consider a slight reduction. Would you be open to discussing a higher offer? Let me know your thoughts!",

I’m really interested in this property and would love to work something out. Looking forward to your reply!",

However, that amount is still below what I can accept for this apartment, which is listed at £2,800. \n\nI can consider a more moderate reduction, perhaps around £2,520 per month, which is about a 10% discount. This would reflect your stable income and guarantor while still keeping the property financially viable for me. Would this be an option you'd consider? Let me know!",
