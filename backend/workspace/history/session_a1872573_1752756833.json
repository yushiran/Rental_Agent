Are utilities included in the rent?\n3. Can you confirm the availability of the property for the lease term I’m looking for?\n\nAdditionally, I’m curious if there’s any flexibility on the rent, as my budget is £1268/month. \n\nI look forward to your response.

Unfortunately, utilities are not included in the rent, so those would be an additional expense.\n\nRegarding availability, the property is currently vacant and ready for immediate lease.\n\nAs for your budget of £1,268, that's quite a bit below my asking price. However, I appreciate your interest, and I'm open to discussing potential flexibility. I could consider a slight discount, but it may not reach your budget.\n\nLet me know how you’d like to proceed!",
