Here are some key details:\n\n- **Rent:** £4,117 pcm (£950 pw)\n- **Lease Duration:** Typically, I prefer a minimum of 12 months.\n- **Amenities:** The flat features a well-proportioned reception room with elegant parquet flooring, a modern bespoke kitchen, and an antique 1940s French crystal chandelier.\n\nRegarding your budget of £623 per month, it is significantly below my asking price. However, I’m open to negotiation. If you can adjust your budget a bit closer to the asking price, we can explore options. \n\nLet me know your thoughts!",
