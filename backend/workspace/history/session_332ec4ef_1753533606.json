Unfortunately, this is significantly above your budget. \n\nThe apartment features modern amenities, including a spacious living area, well-equipped kitchen, and access to communal spaces within a vibrant development. \n\nWhile I appreciate your budget, I typically cannot lower the rent below £2,800, as it reflects the market value in that area. If your budget is flexible, I’d be happy to discuss it further.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n\nBest,  \nHome Made",
