Unfortunately, this exceeds your budget of £1,468 per month.\n\nRegarding amenities, the apartment is part of a contemporary development set in the vibrant Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, offering a modern living experience. However, please note that this property is not pet-friendly, and smoking is prohibited.\n\nIf your budget can stretch closer to the asking price, I might consider negotiating. Otherwise, I can keep you informed of other suitable properties that may become available. Let me know how you would like to proceed!",
