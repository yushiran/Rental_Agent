The rent is £2,800 per month, which is above your budget. However, I appreciate your responsibility as a tenant and would be open to negotiating. \n\nIf you're able to increase your budget slightly, we might find a middle ground. Additionally, please note that there is a 6-week deposit required. Let me know how you’d like to proceed!",
