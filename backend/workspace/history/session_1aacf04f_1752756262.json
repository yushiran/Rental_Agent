My budget is £933/month, so if the rent is slightly above that, I’d like to discuss the possibility of negotiating it. \n\nAlso, could you let me know about the pet policy since I have a pet?

If you’re flexible, we might find a middle ground.\n\nUnfortunately, the property is not pet-friendly, which may be a concern for you. The apartment includes modern amenities, such as a fully equipped kitchen, spacious living area, and access to communal facilities within the development. The overall condition of the property is excellent, as it’s part of a contemporary development in a vibrant area.\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed!",
