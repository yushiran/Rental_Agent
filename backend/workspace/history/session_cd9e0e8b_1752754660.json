Can you provide details about the amenities and pet policy?\n3. What is the length of the lease?\n\nI have a stable income of over £128,000 annually and am looking for a 1-2 bedroom place. I'm also a responsible tenant, and I have two occupants, both of whom are non-smokers. I look forward to your response!",

I'm open to discussing flexibility in pricing, especially if your budget is within a reasonable range.\n  \n2. The property is pet-friendly, so you're welcome to bring your pets! Smoking, however, is not allowed on the premises. \n\n3. The lease length is typically 12 months, but I can be flexible based on your needs.\n\nWith your stable income and responsible tenancy, I believe you'd be a great fit. Let me know if you have any more questions or if you'd like to discuss pricing further!",
