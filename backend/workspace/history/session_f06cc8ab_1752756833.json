The 2-bedroom apartment at Makers House offers modern amenities including a fitted kitchen, spacious living area, and access to communal facilities. It's located in the vibrant Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park area, which has excellent transport links, parks, and local shops.\n\nRegarding the rent, I understand your budget of £919/month is below the asking price of £2,800/month. While I typically wouldn't go below £2,800, I can consider some flexibility. How about we meet in the middle? \n\nLet me know your thoughts!",
