Are utilities included in the rent?\n3. Can you provide more details about the pet policy?\n4. Is the property furnished or unfurnished?\n\nI'm currently looking for a 2-bedroom place within my budget of £1278/month. I also want to highlight that I have a stable income from my studies, and I'm a responsible tenant. Thank you!",

Utilities are not included in the rent; tenants are responsible for those costs.\n3. Unfortunately, the property is not pet-friendly.\n4. The apartment is unfurnished, allowing you to personalize it as you wish.\n\nSince your budget is £1,278/month, which is significantly below the asking price, I can offer you a slight discount if you're a reliable tenant.
