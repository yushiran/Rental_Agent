The property I have available is a stunning 2-bedroom apartment at Makers House, Stratford, E20, with a monthly rent of £2,800. \n\n**Location:** It's set in the vibrant Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Hackney Wick, offering great access to parks, transport, and local amenities.\n\n**Amenities:** The apartment features modern finishes, spacious living areas, and is pet-friendly.\n\nRegarding your budget, it does exceed your limit significantly. However, I'm open to negotiating a slight discount. If you could increase your budget a bit, we might be able to find a middle ground. Would you be able to consider something closer to £2,500/month? \n\nLet me know your thoughts!",
