There are no additional fees mentioned, but I recommend confirming any specifics during our discussions.\n\nRegarding amenities, this 2-bedroom apartment offers a contemporary design, located in the vibrant Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Nearby transport links include excellent access to public transport, making it easy to get around London.\n\nWith your budget being £852 per month, there is a significant gap from the asking price. I typically consider negotiations within a 15% range of my asking rent. Would you like to discuss a different budget or perhaps other options?",
