This 2-bedroom apartment includes amenities such as a modern kitchen, spacious living area, and access to communal spaces within the development. \n\nRegarding the rent, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. The asking price is £2,800 pcm, which is quite a bit above your budget of £628/month. While I'm open to negotiation, I typically consider offers within 15% of the asking price. Perhaps we can discuss a more feasible range? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!",

Please let me know if there's any flexibility on your end, and we can discuss further!",
