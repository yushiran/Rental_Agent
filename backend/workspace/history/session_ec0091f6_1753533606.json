This property is situated in a vibrant area near Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.\n\nRegarding requirements, I accept pets, but smoking is not allowed. The deposit is 6 weeks' rent. Given your budget of £827/month, it seems quite a bit below the asking price. Would you be open to discussing your budget further, or perhaps considering a shared arrangement? Let me know your thoughts!",
